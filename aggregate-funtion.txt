Aggregate functions compute a single result from a set of input values. The built-in normal aggregate functions are listed in Table 9-49 and Table 9-50. The built-in ordered-set aggregate functions are listed in Table 9-51 and Table 9-52. Grouping operations, which are closely related to aggregate functions, are listed in Table 9-53. The special syntax considerations for aggregate functions are explained in Section 4.2.7. Consult Section 2.7 for additional introductory information.
